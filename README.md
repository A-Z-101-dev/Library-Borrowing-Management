# Library-Borrowing-Management
this project is about managing borrowing and books from a library,
with reports of who has to return the borrowed books, CRUD on borrowers, books, publishers and more,
with the reports section you can see who has to return the books they borrowed after a semester is passed,
and including if a certain book is out of stock.
